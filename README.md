** 'AI/ML Researcher'

👋 About Me

I am an aspiring AI/ML Researcher currently pursuing my Master’s at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore. My work focuses on Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms, with applications in Graph-based Learning, Recommendation Systems, and Generative AI.

I am interested in building scalable and efficient learning models, exploring the theoretical aspects of representation learning, and applying advanced neural architectures to solve real-world problems in vision, language, and social-aware systems.
